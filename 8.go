/*
Interfaces. Part 2. Exploring standard library useful interfaces. Implementing
one or two of them.

Start by giving a speech about how in Go, a lot of things are done via interfaces.

Useful interfaces to know about: io.Reader, http.Handler (which we will implement
later), json.Marshaler/Unmarshaler, net.Conn, driver.Driver, Context

The exercise we'll do is a few implementations of io.Reader. We'll use io.readall (show the implementation!!)
which is supposed to read from a stream. We'll first use String Reader, then
implement a custom one.

Here it's probably a good point to do files and errors, or at least in close
proximity. And make sure to go thorugh the library and show them that they
actually implement the interface. e.g. for file, show the Read implementation.
