Useful standard library packages to know about:

- strings
- slices
- maps
- encoding/json
- os
- context

Useful golang glossary (words that they can use to search up stuff):

- interface: https://go.dev/tour/methods/9
- named return values: https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#named-results
- receiver argument: https://go.dev/tour/methods/1

Topics:

- packages
- types
- - int, float64, uint
- - string
- - bool
- - arrays, slices, maps

Notes:

- packages and modules are not the most straightforward concepts, and perhaps
if we discuss it it's worth diving deeper. The go get commands from the slide
will also not work unless a module is initialized. I would not discuss this 
the beginning, rather introduce it along the workshop as we have more code
- I would not cover user-defined types other than structs unless we have a
nice problem during the workshop where it has a fitting use-case
- The variable types section is probably redundant
- The disadvantage of global variables
- slices are used quite often so it's worth distinguishing between uninitialized
and initialized slices, going over length and capacity, and initializing a slice
with a single argument
